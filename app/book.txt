Introduction -

I created this guide becuase it's full of information I wish I had years ago, after technologies such as Backbone.js, Node.js, and Yeoman, Bower, and Grunt came about. With that said, I would like to answer a few questions for you about this guide... 

What type of guide is this?

I have a lot of opinions, and I will not be going over them in this guide. I will show you how to get setup and use Backbone.js, quickly. 

What do I need to know to really learn something from this guide?

I assume you're a web developer with a basic understanding of the following technologies: Git and GitHub, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and how to use your terminal. If you don't understand those technologies, get to work and this guide is a great next step for you!

What makes this guide worth my time?

I will teach you how to get setup and build an application with Backbone.js, and I promise that there will be no "WTF, I'm lost..." moments. This is a guide that shows you the basics of Backbone.js development, and how to use it.

Anything else I should know?
